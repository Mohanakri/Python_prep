Here’s a list of commonly used Python modules, grouped by purpose, that are widely used in interviews, real-world projects, and production code:


---

1. Built-in Standard Library Modules (No installation needed)

General Utility

math – for mathematical functions

random – for generating random numbers

datetime – for date and time manipulation

time – for time-related functions (e.g., sleep, timestamps)

os – for interacting with the operating system

sys – for system-specific parameters and functions

functools – for higher-order functions like reduce, lru_cache

itertools – for efficient looping and combinatorics

collections – for advanced data structures (e.g., Counter, deque, defaultdict)

re – for regular expressions


File Handling / Data Processing

json – to work with JSON data

csv – to read/write CSV files

pickle – for object serialization


Debugging and Profiling

logging – for logging messages

traceback – for printing error stack traces

cProfile – for profiling code performance

2. External (Third-party) Modules (Require installation)

Data Analysis / Machine Learning

numpy – for numerical operations

pandas – for data analysis and manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization

scikit-learn – for machine learning

tensorflow, pytorch – for deep learning


Web and APIs

requests – for HTTP requests

flask / fastapi – for building REST APIs

beautifulsoup4, scrapy – for web scraping
